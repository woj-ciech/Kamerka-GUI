## Search

## Search for Industrial Control Devices in specific country

- "All results" checkbox means get all results from Shodan, if it's turned off - only first page (100) results will be downloaded.
- "Own database" checkbox does not work but shows that is possible to integrate your own geolocation database. Let me know if you have access to better than Shodan's default one.

## Search for Internet of things in specific coordinates

Type your coordinates in format "lat,lon", hardcoded radius is 20km.

## Contribution

I really care about feedback from you. If you have any idea how to make tool better, I'm more than happy to hear it.
It's also possible to upload and host the tool online, if you want to help, dm me.

## TODO

- Live monitoring
- Offensive capabilities
- More devices
- More sources (Instagram?, Youtube?)
- Integration with Nmap and plcscan
- Extensive error checking/debugging
- Cleanup code, delete legacy/unused dependencies js, css files
- Keeping keys in db
- Your ideas

## Remarks

- Tested only on Kali Linux 2019.3
- It uses default sqlite Django database
- Buttons in Intel tab for device do not show the progress bars, you have a results in max couple of seconds.
- Own database button does not work, it shows that it's possible to load your own geolocation database. I haven't found better than Shodan's but let me know if you have access to one.
- Looking for nearby Tweets works but I wasn't able to find any tweets. It may be a problem with Twitter API. Let me know if you can find anything.
- Don't blame me for unintentional bug that might exhaust your Shodan/BinaryEdge/WHOISXMLAPI credits.
- I'm not responsible for any damage caused by using this tool.
